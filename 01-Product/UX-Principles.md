# UX Principles
tags: #spec

1) **Counts must match the list.** Never show metrics computed from a different population.
2) **Filters must be safe.** If empty, explain why + give one-click fixes.
3) **One primary control per dimension.**
   - Tabs = Type
   - Pills = Area/Domain
   - Toggle = State (Open/Done/All)
4) **Exclusive bucket naming must be explicit.**
   - Use “Upcoming (rest of week)” if today is excluded.
5) **Reduce “brain waste.”** Prefer clarity over cleverness.
