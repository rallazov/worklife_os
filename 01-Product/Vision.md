## One sentence
Worklife OS turns messy inputs (email/notes) into a trusted workbench so you never miss obligations.

## The wedge
**Situational certainty**: counts + safe filters + reliable automation (no “did I miss something?” anxiety).

## Who it’s for (MVP)
Busy person with overlapping life domains:
- bills/taxes/insurance
- kids/school
- job security / job hunt
- work projects
- personal projects

## What makes it valuable vs “just GPT”
- system of record + consistent counts
- always-on automation (sync, triage, reminders)
- safe filtering + debuggable empty states
