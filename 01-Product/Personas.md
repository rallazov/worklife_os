## Composite MVP Persona (recommended)
Busy parent + job-risk + bills/taxes + personal projects.

### Pain
- Cognitive anxiety (“did I miss something?”)
- Context switching between domains
- Too many sources (email, texts, paper, portals)

### What they need
- Trusted counts per domain/state
- Fast triage
- “Show me what matters this week”
- Safe filters (never blank without explanation)

## Secondary personas (later)
- Job seeker / career switcher
- Small business owner
- Healthcare professional admin load
